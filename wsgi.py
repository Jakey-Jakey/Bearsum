# wsgi.py (Revised and Simplified)

# Simply import the configured app instance from your main application file.
# No other logic should be here for uWSGI deployment.
from app import app

# If you were using an application factory pattern (def create_app(): ... return app),
# you would call it here:
# from app import create_app
# app = create_app()
